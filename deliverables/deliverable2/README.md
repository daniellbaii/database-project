## 📊 Database Schema

The database implements a normalized (3NF) structure with 7 tables:

### Core Tables
- **VOLUNTEER** - Stores volunteer personal information
- **ORGANISATION** - Partner organizations coordinating events
- **SKILL** - Available skills for volunteers
- **EVENT** - Volunteer opportunities and activities

### Junction Tables (Many-to-Many Relationships)
- **VOLUNTEER_EVENT** - Volunteer event registrations
- **VOLUNTEER_SKILL** - Volunteer skill proficiencies
- **EVENT_SKILL** - Required skills for events

### Key Features
- **Foreign Key Constraints** with CASCADE operations
- **Data Validation** through CHECK constraints
- **Unique Constraints** for emails and names
- **Default Values** for registration dates
- **Comprehensive Sample Data** (20+ records)

---

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Database Operations
```
✓ Database connection successful!
✓ Found 6 volunteers in database
✓ Found 4 organisations in database  
✓ Found 5 events in database
```

### CRUD Operations Testing
```
1. CREATE Operation Test:
   ✅ Successfully created volunteer with ID: 7

2. READ Operation Test:
   ✅ Successfully retrieved 4 organisations

## 📖 ACID Properties Implementation

Comprehensive documentation is provided in `ACID_Properties_Documentation.md` covering:

### Atomicity
- Transaction rollback on failures
- All-or-nothing operations
- Example: Volunteer registration with skills

### Consistency

- Data validation rules
- Business logic integrity

### Isolation
- Concurrent transaction safety
- SQLite locking mechanisms
- Multi-user access protection

### Durability
- Permanent data persistence
- System failure recovery
- Transaction logging
