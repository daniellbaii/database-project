### Advanced Features Implemented

#### Skill-Based Volunteer Search
- Search volunteers by specific skills (e.g., 'First Aid Certified')
- Proficiency level filtering and sorting
- Experience-based ranking system

#### Multi-Table JOIN Queries
- Organisation volunteers view requiring 3+ table INNER JOINs
- Complex relationship traversal across VOLUNTEER, VOLUNTEER_EVENT, EVENT, ORGANISATION
- Real-time data integration

#### Aggregate Statistics Dashboard
- Event volunteer counts using COUNT() and GROUP BY
- Average event duration calculations
- Organisation engagement metrics
- Skill distribution analysis

#### Calculated Fields Display
- Concatenated full names (first_name || ' ' || last_name) AS full_name
- Calculated ages from date of birth using julianday() functions
- Proper alias usage for new field names
- Age distribution summaries
