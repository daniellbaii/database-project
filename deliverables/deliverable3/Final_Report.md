## 1. Introduction and Problem Definition

### Project Context

Local community groups and non-profit organisations struggle to efficiently manage volunteer recruitment and coordination. Volunteers similarly face challenges discovering opportunities that match their skills and availability. This disconnect results in underutilised community resources and unmet organisational needs.

### Problem Statement

The primary challenge is the lack of centralised systems for volunteer coordination, leading to:
- Inefficient volunteer recruitment processes
- Mismatched skill sets and opportunities
- Administrative burden on community organisations  
- Limited visibility of available volunteer opportunities
- Difficulty tracking volunteer engagement and impact

### Solution Approach

Community Connect addresses these challenges through:
- Centralised volunteer and organisation database
- Skill-based matching system
- Event management and registration
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics
- User-friendly web interface

### Success Criteria

1. **Functional Requirements**: Complete CRUD operations, advanced queries, multi-table relationships
2. **Technical Standards**: Normalised database design (3NF), SQL implementation, web application integration
3. **User Experience**: Intuitive interface, responsive design, comprehensive functionality
4. **Compliance**: Australian Privacy Principles adherence, data security measures
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive reporting, design documentation, evaluation analysis

### Entity Relationship Diagram

The Community Connect system implements a robust 7-table database structure using Crow's Foot notation:

**Core Entities:**
- **VOLUNTEER**: Individual volunteer information
- **ORGANISATION**: Community partner organisations  
- **EVENT**: Volunteer opportunities and activities
- **SKILL**: Master skill repository

**Junction Tables:**
- **VOLUNTEER_EVENT**: M:N relationship resolving volunteer event registrations
- **VOLUNTEER_SKILL**: M:N relationship linking volunteers to their skills
- **EVENT_SKILL**: M:N relationship defining event skill requirements

### Database Normalisation

**Normalisation Process (0NF â†’ 3NF):**

**0NF (Unnormalised):** Single table with repeating groups and data redundancy
- Problems: Data duplication, update anomalies, storage inefficiency

**1NF (First Normal Form):** Eliminated repeating groups, atomic values only
- Achievement: Each cell contains single values, no multi-valued attributes

**2NF (Second Normal Form):** Removed partial dependencies
- Achievement: All non-key attributes fully dependent on entire primary key

**3NF (Third Normal Form):** Eliminated transitive dependencies  
- Achievement: No non-key attributes dependent on other non-key attributes

### Data Dictionary

Comprehensive documentation includes:
- 7 table specifications with 45+ attributes
- Data types, lengths, and constraints
- Primary and foreign key relationships
- Business rule implementations
- Referential integrity specifications

**Organisation Volunteer View:** 3+ table INNER JOIN across VOLUNTEER, VOLUNTEER_EVENT, EVENT, and ORGANISATION tables

**SQL Implementation:**
```sql
SELECT v.volunteer_id, v.first_name, v.last_name, v.email, v.phone,
       e.event_name, e.start_date, e.location,
       ve.registration_date, ve.attendance_status,
       o.org_name
FROM VOLUNTEER v
INNER JOIN VOLUNTEER_EVENT ve ON v.volunteer_id = ve.volunteer_id
INNER JOIN EVENT e ON ve.event_id = e.event_id
INNER JOIN ORGANISATION o ON e.org_id = o.org_id
WHERE o.org_id = ?
ORDER BY e.start_date, v.last_name, v.first_name
```

### Aggregate Statistics

**Event Statistics with COUNT and GROUP BY:**
```sql
SELECT e.event_name, o.org_name,
       COUNT(ve.volunteer_id) as volunteer_count,
       e.max_volunteers,
       CAST((julianday(e.end_date) - julianday(e.start_date)) AS INTEGER) as duration_days
FROM EVENT e
JOIN ORGANISATION o ON e.org_id = o.org_id
LEFT JOIN VOLUNTEER_EVENT ve ON e.event_id = ve.event_id
GROUP BY e.event_id, e.event_name, o.org_name, e.max_volunteers, e.start_date, e.end_date
ORDER BY volunteer_count DESC
```

### Calculated Fields with Aliases

**Volunteer Directory with Concatenated Names and Calculated Ages:**
```sql
SELECT volunteer_id,
       (first_name || ' ' || last_name) as full_name,
       email, phone, address,
       date_of_birth,
       CAST((julianday('now') - julianday(date_of_birth)) / 365.25 AS INTEGER) as age,
       registration_date
FROM VOLUNTEER
ORDER BY full_name
```

## 6. ACID Properties Implementation

The Community Connect database system demonstrates robust implementation of all four ACID properties to ensure reliable and robust data transactions.

### Atomicity (All-or-Nothing Transactions)

**Definition:** All operations within a transaction are treated as a single, indivisible unit. Either all operations succeed and are committed, or if any operation fails, all changes are rolled back.

**Implementation Example - Volunteer Registration:**
```python
def create_volunteer_with_skills(first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, email, phone, address, skills):
    conn = get_db_connection()
    try:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        
        # Step 1: Create volunteer record
        cursor.execute(
            "INSERT INTO VOLUNTEER (first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, email, phone, address) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)",
            (first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, email, phone, address)
        )
        volunteer_id = cursor.lastrowid
        
        # Step 2: Add volunteer skills
        for skill_id, proficiency, experience in skills:
            cursor.execute(
                "INSERT INTO VOLUNTEER_SKILL (volunteer_id, skill_id, proficiency_level, years_experience) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
                (volunteer_id, skill_id, proficiency, experience)
            )
        
        # All operations succeed - commit atomically
        conn.commit()
        return volunteer_id
        
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        # Any failure rolls back ALL changes
        conn.rollback()
        return None
    finally:
        conn.close()
```

### Consistency (Data Integrity Maintenance)

**Definition:** All database constraints, rules, and relationships are maintained before and after every transaction.

**Implementation Features:**
- **Email uniqueness constraints:** `email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE CHECK(email LIKE '%@%.%')`
- **Foreign key relationships:** Maintain referential integrity across tables
- **Data validation:** Phone number length, date ranges, proficiency levels
- **Business rules:** Event capacity limits, age requirements

### Isolation (Concurrent Transaction Safety)

**Definition:** Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Each transaction operates as if it's the only transaction running.

**SQLite Implementation:**
- Automatic locking mechanisms prevent transaction interference
- IMMEDIATE transactions provide enhanced isolation when needed
- Multiple users can update different volunteers simultaneously
- Consistent data views maintained during concurrent access

### Durability (Permanent Data Persistence)

**Definition:** Once a transaction is committed, it remains permanently stored in the database, even in the event of system crashes or power failures.

**SQLite Durability Features:**
- Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mode for better durability
- Synchronous commits ensure data written to disk before return
- Transaction logs maintain change history
- Database integrity checks and checksums

### ACID Properties Summary

| Property | Implementation | Community Connect Benefit |
|----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Atomicity** | Transaction rollback on failure | Volunteer registration with skills either succeeds completely or fails completely |
| **Consistency** | Database constraints & validation | Email uniqueness prevents duplicate accounts; capacity limits maintained |
| **Isolation** | SQLite locking mechanisms | Multiple admins can update different volunteers simultaneously without conflicts |
| **Durability** | WAL mode & transaction logs | Committed volunteer registrations survive power outages and system crashes |
